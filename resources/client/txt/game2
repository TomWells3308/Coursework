OBJECT OF THE GAME
The goal is to form and discard pairs of cards, and not to be left with the odd card (a queen) at the end.
THE DEAL
Any player shuffles the pack and deals them around, one at a time to each player, until all the cards have been handed out. Players do not need to have an equal number of cards.
THE PLAY
Each player removes all pairs from his hand face down. If a player has three-of-a-kind, they remove only two of those three cards. The dealer then offers their hand, spread out face down, to the player on the left, who draws one card from it. This player discards any pair that may have been formed by the drawn card. The player then offers their own hand to the player on their left. Play proceeds in this way until all cards have been paired except one - the odd queen, which cannot be paired - and the player who has that card is the Old Maid!
